            "\n",
            "An `IndexError` in Python occurs when you try to access an element in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) using an index that does not exist. This can happen when you're trying to access an element at an index that's out of range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example Code**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a simple example:\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
            "print(my_list[3])  # IndexError: list index out of range\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, we're trying to access the element at index 3 in the list `[1, 2, 3]`, but since the list only has 3 elements (at indices 0, 1, and 2), this raises an `IndexError`.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Solution**\n",
            "\n",
            "To avoid `IndexError`, you can use one of the following approaches:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Check the length of the sequence**: Before accessing an element, check if the index is within the valid range using the `len()` function.\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
            "index = 3\n",
            "if index < len(my_list):\n",

            "    print(\"Index out of range\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "2. **Use a try-except block**: Wrap the code that accesses the element in a try-except block to catch the `IndexError` exception and handle it accordingly.\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
            "index = 3\n",
            "try:\n",
            "    print(my_list[index])\n",
            "except IndexError:\n",
            "    print(\"Index out of range\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "3. **Use the `in` operator**: If you're trying to check if an element exists in a sequence, use the `in` operator instead of accessing it by index.\n",
            "```python\n",
            "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
            "if index in my_list:\n",
            "    print(f\"Element {index} exists in the list\")\n",
            "else:\n",
            "    print(\"Element does not exist in the list\")\n",

            "\n",
            "To avoid `IndexError`, always check the length of the sequence or use a try-except block to handle the exception.\n",

            "* If you're working with a dictionary, use the `keys()` method to get a list of keys and then access the corresponding value using the `get()` method or the `[]` operator.\n",
            "* If you're working with a NumPy array, use the `ndarray` indexing syntax (e.g., `my_array[i, j]`) to access elements safely.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Enable debug mode**: Temporarily enable debug mode in your API to get more detailed error messages. This will help you identify the exact line of code where the error is occurring.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Check API request and response**: Verify that the API request is being sent correctly and that the response is being returned correctly. Use a tool like Postman or curl to make a test request to your API.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Check database connection**: If your API is using a database, ensure that the connection is established correctly. If it's not, you'll get a 500 error.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Check for unhandled exceptions**: Make sure that all unhandled exceptions are caught and logged. This will prevent the server from crashing and give you a chance to handle the error.\n",
